Hi I'm Morty. Here's some facts about me:

<li>I am not a small bird, I'm average</li>
<li>Flying is hard, but I'm getting better</li>
<li>Millet seeds are life</li>
<li>If I'm on the fan, then I'm better than you</li>
<li>If I'm on the light, then I'm better than you</li>
<li>I like scritches</li>
